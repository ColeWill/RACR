write a function to geolocate (update user location) every certain number of seconds

try check to see if current lat long = destination lat long

when current = destination show an alert

I think leaflet can be run over mapbox???? and mapbox does have documentation for click events...

Latitude and Longitude precision

The units digit (one decimal degree) gives a position up to 111 kilometers (60 nautical miles, about 69 miles). It can tell us roughly what large state or country we are in.

The first decimal place is worth up to 11.1 km: it can distinguish the position of one large city from a neighboring large city.

The second decimal place is worth up to 1.1 km: it can separate one village from the next.

The third decimal place is worth up to 110 m: it can identify a large agricultural field or institutional campus.

The fourth decimal place is worth up to 11 m: it can identify a parcel of land. It is comparable to the typical accuracy of an uncorrected GPS unit with no interference.

The fifth decimal place is worth up to 1.1 m: it distinguish trees from each other. Accuracy to this level with commercial GPS units can only be achieved with differential correction.
